This repository contains tasks that I have  accomplished during my internship at Nullclass.
**Library used: OpenCV,NumPy**
There are  3 tasks in this  Repository as assigned by the Nullclass Team.

### Task1:  Detect if a person's eyes are closed or open.
This task detects closed and open eyes of a person in real time.I have used *haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml* and  *haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml* to detect face and eyes of a person.


### Task2:  Detect if a person's mouth is open or closed.
This task detects if aperson's mouth is opened or closed in real time.I have used *haarcascade_mcs_mouth* to detect mouth of the person.The program shows gray frame when a person's mouth is opened and 2 circles along the ends of mouth when it is closed.

### Task3:  Detect if a person's face has wrinkle or not.
I have completed this task both for real time video and image.I have looped through each contour to detect if person has wrinkle on his/her.I have used image dataset to detect wrinkles in an image with help of canny and contours.








Any feedback is warmly welcomed.Thank you.
